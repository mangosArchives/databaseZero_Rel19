Due to technical reasons in how targetting is handled, the eventAI script cannot target anything or anyone that is not in its threat list or is not the scripted creature itself. It also can\'t currently target anyone specific in its threat list except by their position in the threat list. However, even then it can only target specifically the current victim, the second unit in its threat list, and the last unit in its threat list. It can also target units in its threat list at random and has two options for that: anyone in its threat list at random, or anyone in its threat list excluding the unit with the most threat. Aside from all of those external targets, the script can always target itself. More information on the target types can be found in the reference tables at the end of this guide.\r\n\r\nOne last note before we start looking at individual actions is about the texts. The eventAI script has support for localized text entries. Therefore, you can define what the mob will say in more than one language all in another table and the script will show the corresponding localized text to the corresponding client (english text to enUS/enGB clients, german text to deDE clients, etc). All of the localized text entries will have a unique text ID assigned to them and it is that text ID that will be used by any actions that require textual input.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<pre>\r\n* *0 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;NONE*: Does nothing!\r\n\r\n* *1 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;SAY*: Displays the -TextId as defined. In case -TextId2 and optionally -TextId3, the output will be randomized. Type text are defined in the \"eventai_texts\":eventai_texts table (say, yell, whisper, etc) along with other options for the text. All values are required to be negative.\r\n** Parameter 1: The entry of the text that the NPC should use from \"eventai_texts\":eventai_texts table. Optionally a entry from other tables can be used (such as \"custom_texts\":custom_texts).Entry are required to be negative and exist in a &#42;&#95;texts-table. The type text to be displayed are defined in the texts-table itself (Say, Yell, Whisper, Emote Text, Boss Whisper, Boss Emote)Other options are also to be defined in the texts-table, such as a sound to be heard with the text and the language used in output (common, dwarvish, etc).In case this entry has a localized version of the text, the localized text will be displayed in client that support this locale.\r\n** Parameter 2: Optional. TextId can be defined in addition. The same apply to this as explained above, however eventAI will randomize between the two.\r\n** Parameter 3: Optional, if Parameter 2 exist. In this case, eventAI will randomize between three.\r\n\r\n* *2 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;YELL*: UNUSED\r\n\r\n* *3 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;TEXTEMOTE*: UNUSED\r\n\r\n* *4 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;SOUND*: When activated, the creature will play the specified sound.\r\n** Parameter 1: The sound ID to be played. Sound IDs are contained in the DBC files.\r\n\r\n* *5 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;EMOTE*: When activated, the creature will perform a visual emote. Unlike a text emote, a visual emote is one where the creature will actually move or perform a gesture.\r\n** Parameter 1: The emote ID that the creature should perform. Emote IDs are also contained in the DBC but they can be found in the mangos source as well.\r\n\r\n* *6 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;RANDOM&#95;SAY*: UNUSED\r\n\r\n* *7 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;RANDOM&#95;YELL*: UNUSED\r\n\r\n* *8 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;RANDOM&#95;TEXTEMOTE*: UNUSED\r\n\r\n* *9 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;RANDOM&#95;SOUND*: Similar to the ACTION&#95;T&#95;SOUND action, when this action is activated, it will choose at random a sound to play. This action needs all three parameters to be filled and it will pick a random entry from the three. NOTE: (1)\r\n** Parameter 1: The sound ID to be played as choice one.\r\n** Parameter 2: The sound ID to be played as choice two.\r\n** Parameter 3: The sound ID to be played as choice three.\r\n\r\n* *10 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;RANDOM&#95;EMOTE*: Similar to the ACTION&#95;T&#95;EMOTE action, when this action is activated, it will choose at random an emote ID to emote visually. This action needs all three parameters to be filled and it will pick a random entry from the three. NOTE: (1)\r\n** Parameter 1: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice one.\r\n** Parameter 2: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice two.\r\n** Parameter 3: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice three.\r\n\r\n* *11 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;CAST*: When activated, the creature will cast a spell specified by a spell ID on a target specified by the target type.\r\n** Parameter 1: The spell ID to use for the cast. The value used in this field needs to be a valid spell ID.\r\n** Parameter 2: The target type defining who the creature should cast on. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below.\r\n** Parameter 3: See \"spell flags\":creature_ai_scripts#cast-flags. If it is 1, then the spell cast will interrupt any spells that are already in the progress of being casted; otherwise if the creature is already casting a spell and this field is 0, then this action will be skipped.\r\n\r\n* *12 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;SUMMON*: When activated, the creature will summon another creature at the same spot as itself that will attack the specified target.\r\n** Parameter 1: The creature template ID to be summoned. The value here needs to be a valid creature template ID.\r\n** Parameter 2: The target type defining who the summoned creature will attack. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below. NOTE: Using target type 0 will cause the summoned creature to not attack anyone.\r\n** Parameter 3: The duration until the summoned creature should be unsummoned. The value in this field is in milliseconds or 0. If zero, then the creature will not be unsummoned until it leaves combat, but only works with t&#95;type !=0.\r\n\r\n* *13 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;THREAT&#95;SINGLE&#95;PCT*: When activated, this action will modify the threat of a target in the creature\'s threat list by the specified percent.\r\n** Parameter 1: Threat percent that should be modified. The value in this field can range from -100 to +100. If it is negative, threat will be taken away and if positive, threat will be added.\r\n** Parameter 2: The target type defining on whom the threat change should occur. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below.\r\n\r\n* *14 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;THREAT&#95;ALL&#95;PCT*: When activated, this action will modify the threat for everyone in the creature\'s threat list by the specified percent.\r\n** Parameter 1: The percent that should be used in modifying everyone\'s threat in the creature\'s threat list. The value here can range from -100 to +100. NOTE: Using -100 will cause the creature to reset everyone\'s threat to 0 so that everyone has the same amount of threat. It does NOT make any changes as to who is in the threat list.\r\n\r\n* *15 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;QUEST&#95;EVENT*: When activated, this action will satisfy the external completion requirement for the quest for the specified target defined by the target type. This action can only be used with player targets so it must be ensured that the target type will point to a player.\r\n** Parameter 1: The quest template ID. The value here must be a valid quest template ID. Furthermore, the quest should have SpecialFlags &#124; 2 as it would need to be completed by an external event which is the activation of this action.\r\n** Parameter 2: The target type defining whom the quest should be completed for. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below.\r\n\r\n* *16 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;CASTCREATUREGO*: When activated, this action will call CastedCreatureOrGO() function for the player.

More information on the field value indeces can be found at \"character data\":character data.\r\n** Parameter 1: The index of the field number to be changed. Use \"character data\":character data for a list of indeces and what they control. Note that a creature shares the same indeces with a player except for the PLAYER&#95;&#42; ones.\r\n** Parameter 2: The new value to be put in the field.\r\n** Parameter 3: The target type defining for whom the unit field should be changed. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below.\r\n\r\n* *18 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;SET&#95;UNIT&#95;FLAG*: When activated, this action changes the target\'s \"flags\":https://github.com/cmangos/issues/wiki/Creature_template#unitflags by adding (turning on) more flags. For example, this action can make the creature unattackable/unselectable if the right flags are used.\r\n** Parameter 1: The flag(s) to be set. Multiple flags can be set by using bitwise-OR on them (adding them together).\r\n** Parameter 2: The target type defining for whom the flags should be changed.

For example, this action can make the creature normal after it was unattackable/unselectable if the right flags are used.\r\n** Parameter 1: The flag(s) to be removed. Multiple flags can be set by using bitwise-OR on them (adding them together).\r\n** Parameter 2: The target type defining for whom the flags should be changed. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below.\r\n\r\n* *20 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;AUTO&#95;ATTACK*: This action controls whether or not the creature should stop or start the auto melee attack.\r\n** Parameter 1: If zero, then the creature will stop its melee attacks. If non-zero, then the creature will either continue its melee attacks (the action would then have no effect) or it will start its melee attacks on the target with the top threat if its melee attacks were previously stopped.\r\n\r\n* *21 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;COMBAT&#95;MOVEMENT*: This action controls whether or not the creature will always move towards its target.\r\n** Parameter 1: If zero, then the creature will stop moving towards its victim (if its victim gets out of melee range) and will be stationary. If non-zero, then the creature will either continue to follow its victim (the action would have no effect) or it will start to follow the target with the top threat if its movement was disabled before.\r\n\r\n* *22 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;SET&#95;PHASE*: When activated, this action sets the creature\'s event to the specified value.\r\n** Parameter 1: The new phase to set the creature in. This number must be an integer between 0 and 31 inclusive.\r\n\r\n* *23 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;INC&#95;PHASE*: When activated, this action will increase (or decrease) the current creature\'s phase.\r\n** Parameter 1: The number of phases to increase or decrease.

After increasing or decreasing the phase by this action, the current phase must not be lower than 0 or exceed 31.\r\n\r\n* *24 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;EVADE*: When activated, the creature will immediately exit out of combat, clear its threat list, and move back to its spawn point. Basically, this action will reset the whole encounter.\r\n\r\n* *25 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;FLEE*: When activated, the creature will try to flee from combat. Currently this is done by it casting a fear-like spell on itself called &quot;Run Away&quot;.\r\n\r\n* *26 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;QUEST&#95;EVENT&#95;ALL*: This action does the same thing as the ACTION&#95;T&#95;QUEST&#95;EVENT does but it does it for all players in the creature\'s threat list. Note that if a player is not in its threat list for whatever reason, he/she won\'t get the quest completed.\r\n** Parameter 1: The quest ID to finish for everyone.\r\n\r\n* *27 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;CASTCREATUREGO&#95;ALL*: This action does the same thing as the ACTION&#95;T&#95;CASTCREATUREGO does but it does it for all players in the creature\'s threat list. Note that if a player is not in its threat list for whatever reason, he/she won\'t receive the cast emulation.\r\n** Parameter 1: The quest template ID.\r\n** Parameter 2: The spell ID used to simulate the cast.\r\n\r\n* *28 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;REMOVEAURASFROMSPELL*: This action will remove all auras from a specific spell from the target.\r\n** Parameter 1: The target type defining for whom the unit field should be changed. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below.\r\n** Parameter 2: The spell ID whose auras will be removed.\r\n\r\n* *29 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;RANGED&#95;MOVEMENT*: This action changes the movement type generator to ranged type using the specified values for angle and distance. Note that specifying zero angle and distance will make it just melee instead.\r\n** Parameter 1: The distance the mob should keep between it and its target.\r\n** Parameter 2: The angle the mob should use.\r\n\r\n* *30 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;RANDOM&#95;PHASE*: Randomly sets the phase to one from the three parameter choices. NOTE: (1)\r\n** Parameter 1: A possible random phase choice.\r\n** Parameter 2: A possible random phase choice.\r\n** Parameter 3: A possible random phase choice.\r\n\r\n* *31 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;RANDOM&#95;PHASE&#95;RANGE*: Randomly sets the phase between a range of phases controlled by the parameters.\r\n** Parameter 1: The minimum of the phase range.\r\n** Parameter 2: The maximum of the phase range. The number here must be greater than the one in parameter 1.\r\n\r\n* *32 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;SUMMON*: Summons a creature using the data specified in the separate \"summons\":creature_ai_summons table.\r\n** Parameter 1: The creature template ID to be summoned. The value here needs to be a valid creature template ID.\r\n** Parameter 2: The target type defining who the summoned creature will attack. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below. NOTE: Using target type 0 will cause the summoned creature to not attack anyone.\r\n** Parameter 3: The summon ID from the eventai&#95;summons table controlling the position (and spawntime) where the summoned mob should be spawned at.\r\n\r\n* *33 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;KILLED&#95;MONSTER*: When activated, this action will call KilledMonster() function for the player. It can be used to give creature credit for killing a creature (note that it can be ANY creature including certain quest specific triggers). In general if the quest is set to be accompished on different creatures (e.g. &quot;Credit&quot; templates).\r\n** Parameter 1: The creature template ID. The value here must be a valid creature template ID.\r\n** Parameter 2: The target type defining whom the quest kill count should be given to. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below.\r\n\r\n* *34 = ACTION&#95;T&#95;SET&#95;INST&#95;DATA*: Sets data for the instance. Note that this will only work when the creature is inside an instantiable zone that has a valid script (ScriptedInstance) assigned.\r\n** Parameter 1: The field to change in the instance script. Again, this field needs to be a valid field that has been already defined in the instance\'s script.\r\n** Parameter 2: The value to put at that field index.

Such \"support templates\" can be referenced from \"normal\" loot templates. \r\n\r\nWhen a common or artificial loot template is used a problem arises: what ID to use for that template?

Moreover, such rules would be very handy but it seems at the moment there are very few rules explicitly defined. \r\n\r\nAgreements on entry field values are described there. '),
(144,0,'creature_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be defined for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

This is designed to serve a single purpose: to make definition of tier token drops a bit simplier (tokens of a tier are defined as a 100%-chance group of an artificial template and bosses\' loot templates include 100%-chanced reference to that group with repetition factor of 2 or 3 depending on the case). Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). \r\n\r\nNote: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. \r\n'),
(147,0,'creature_loot_template','mincountOrRef','This field defines \r\nwhen positive: the minimum number of copies of the item. ','This field defines \r\n\r\n¦when positive: the minimum number of copies of the item that can drop in a single loot \r\n¦when negative: a reference to another template. \r\nZero value makes no sense and should not be used. \r\n\r\nMeaning of positive values is quite clear and requires no additional comments. References can point to either a whole template or to single group of a template and decribed below. \r\n\r\nTemplate reference\r\nmincountOrRef < 0, group = 0 \r\n\r\nTemplate reference asks core to process another loot template (having entry equal to \"-mincountOrRef\") and to include all items dropped for that template into current loot. Simple idea. \r\n\r\nValue of maxcount field is used as a repetition factor for references - the reference will be processed not just once but exactly maxcount times. So if the referenced template can produce 3 to 10 items (depending on luck) and value of maxcount is \'5\' then after processing of that reference 15 to 50 items will be added to the loot. An awful example, isn\'t it? Actually no good example for whole template reference repetition is known, but it is quite useful for group references sometimes. \r\n\r\nBe careful. Self references (loot template includes reference to itself) and loop references (loot template A includes reference to entire template B, loot template B includes reference to entire template A) are completely different from internal references. If you make a self-reference like \r\n\r\n<pre>INSERT INTO `creature_loot_template` (`entry`,`item`,`mincountOrRef`) VALUES (\'21215\',\'0\',\'-21215\'); </pre>\r\n\r\nthen the core will crash due to stack overflow at first attempt of loot 21215 processing. That is why self references and loop references are strictly forbidden. \r\n\r\nGroup reference\r\nmincountOrRef < 0, group > 0 \r\n\r\nGroup reference asks core to process another loot template (having entry equal to \"-mincountOrRef\") only in the part of one group - with id equal to value of `groupid` field of the reference entry. So this reference may add only none or 1 item into the loot (provided maxcount is equal to 1). \r\n\r\nMeaning of maxcount field value is the same as described in Template reference. \r\n\r\nNote that there is no way to have a reference as a part of a group as such grouped reference would have the same format as reference to group described here. \r\n\r\nThere are two types of group references: \r\n\r\n¦external reference when group reference row has entry different from entry of the referenced group \r\n¦internal reference when group reference row has the same entry as the referenced group. \r\nBasic usage of group references is to avoid repetition of group definitions when several loot sources have common parts of the loot. In this case it is possible: \r\n\r\n¦to define groups with the same contents (items/drop chances) again and again. The simpliest way, but very RAM consumable. \r\n¦to define the group once as a part of one of loot source loot definition and to include group references in loot definitions of the other loot sources instead of repeating group definition. \r\n¦to define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition (having entry not corresponding to any source) and to include group references in loot definitions for every related loot source. \r\nThe first way is deprecated, both second and third use external references. UDB recommends to use the third way. \r\n\r\nAs references have chance to be processed it is possible to use them effiently for zone or world drop definitions. Those drops often have different chances for different loot sources (low/high skill gameobjects, non-elite/elite creatures etc) while having the same contents of the loot. The recommended way to define such drops is as following: \r\n\r\n¦to set up a group with 100% group chance in an artificial loot template (using equal-chanced entries when possible) \r\n¦to include references to that group into loot definition of every related loot source setting the drop chance for the reference. \r\nSome bosses drop more than one tier item (two or three). Loot statistics looks like the same group is rolled 2 or 3 times and every time an item (possible the same) is chosen. It is simple to define a group for single item, but how to define drop for the second and the third? We can: \r\n\r\n¦repeat group definition 2 (or 3) times with change of group id \r\n¦define the group once and include 1 (or 2) internal references. \r\n¦define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include 2 (or 3) external group references. \r\n¦define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include an external group reference with repetition factor of 2 (or 3). \r\nThe in-game results will be the same. But again - the first way is very inefficient and then deprecated. We recommends to use the forth way. \r\n'),

(581,0,'gameobject_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). \r\n\r\nNote: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. \r\n'),

In this case the loot sources have the same value in the link field. \r\n\r\nIt is possible also to set up artificial loot templates which are not used directly at all as they have ID which are not referenced from the related source. Such \"support templates\" can be referenced from \"normal\" loot templates. \r\n\r\nWhen a common or artificial loot template is used a problem arises: what ID to use for that template? Depending on the loot table, different rules can be agreed on to simplify maintenance for the table. Moreover, such rules would be very handy but it seems at the moment there are very few rules explicitly defined. \r\n\r\nAgreements on entry field values are described there. '),
(665,0,'item_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

This is designed to serve a single purpose: to make definition of tier token drops a bit simplier (tokens of a tier are defined as a 100%-chance group of an artificial template and bosses\' loot templates include 100%-chanced reference to that group with repetition factor of 2 or 3 depending on the case). Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). \r\n\r\nNote: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. \r\n'),

(1092,0,'mail_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). \r\n\r\nNote: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. \r\n'),

(1236,0,'pickpocketing_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

For example, when several loot sources should provide the same loot, single loot definition can be used. In this case the loot sources have the same value in the link field. \r\n\r\nIt is possible also to set up artificial loot templates which are not used directly at all as they have ID which are not referenced from the related source. Such \"support templates\" can be referenced from \"normal\" loot templates. \r\n\r\nWhen a common or artificial loot template is used a problem arises: what ID to use for that template? Depending on the loot table, different rules can be agreed on to simplify maintenance for the table. Moreover, such rules would be very handy but it seems at the moment there are very few rules explicitly defined. \r\n\r\nAgreements on entry field values are described there. '),
(1433,0,'reference_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). \r\n\r\nNote: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. \r\n'),

The rows with the same ID defines a single loot. \r\nIt is often the same ID as the loot source (item, creature, etc) but when the link is made not on entry field of the Related table then ID can be different. For example, when several loot sources should provide the same loot, single loot definition can be used. In this case the loot sources have the same value in the link field. \r\n\r\nIt is possible also to set up artificial loot templates which are not used directly at all as they have ID which are not referenced from the related source. Such \"support templates\" can be referenced from \"normal\" loot templates. \r\n\r\nWhen a common or artificial loot template is used a problem arises: what ID to use for that template? Depending on the loot table, different rules can be agreed on to simplify maintenance for the table. Moreover, such rules would be very handy but it seems at the moment there are very few rules explicitly defined. \r\n\r\nAgreements on entry field values are described there. '),
(1487,0,'skinning_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). \r\n\r\nNote: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. \r\n'),
